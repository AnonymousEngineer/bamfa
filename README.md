# BAMFA

Bayesian metabolic flux analysis MATLAB package. Constructs a Bayesian metabolic model and samples the flux posterior, that is flux vectors that are compatible with steady-state, flux upper and lower bounds and flux measurements. The flux posterior is represented by a set of flux samples, or flux pair samples.

Drop-in replacement to standard flux balance analysis (FBA), metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and flux variability analysis (FVA).

Requirements:
- MATLAB
- OpenCobra toolbox installed
